## TODO:

- [ ] Authentication

      - [ ] Role based default permissions, e.g. 

      ```
        roles: [{
          role: {role_string},
          own_records: DELETE,
          other_records: READ | WRITE
        }]
      ```

      - [ ] Auth testing (role based access)

      - [ ] integrate JWT token support + /login endpoint

      - [ ] Auth testing (user/pass, login)

- [ ] Add Demo Database data to Docker setup file

- [ ] Table based permissions JSON file
      [{
        table: {table_name},
        roles: [{
          role: {role_string},
          own_records: READ | WRITE | DELETE,
          other_records: READ | WRITE | DELETE,
          identifer_route: 'user_id', // also supports clients.user_clients.user_id

//replaced by identifer_route if possible?
          <!-- identifier_restrictions: [{
              table: clients,
              column: client_id,
              relation: [{
                type: FK | JOIN
                table: string
                column: string,
              }]
          }] -->
        }]
      }]

      + add for demo database tables where needed

- [ ] setup auth login endpoint

- [ ] get endpoints, support deeper tables (e.g. content_keywords) with format, content/1/keywords 

- [ ] finish endpoint support for mysql 

note: on create/update/upsert, do type checking on data, numbers, enums matching etc
note: delete options (SOFT/HARD). if soft specify name of delete column in table.

- [ ] add full testing

- [ ] Move these docs to juicyllama.com/llana, landing page + docs

- [ ] Add redis support for faster performance (e.g. schema caching, user_identity)

- [ ] containerize and publish to docker

- [ ] use on first external client project

- [ ] move remaining items to github issues

- [ ] add column exclusions (global and by table, e.g. deleted_at, password)

- [ ] Adding more database integrations (postgres, etc)

- [ ] Interface for managing configuration

- [ ] Scope Llana cloud option for non-technical users

- [ ] Scope out Setup / Install service (pay to deploy on your database)

#### Marketing

- [ ] Build integrations with workflow automation tooling (n8n, zapier, make, etc) and promote on their platforms where possible

- [ ] Publish on Daily.dev, ProductHunt, etc 

- [ ] Commend on Medium posts like: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/my-tech-stack-for-building-web-apps-today-43398556bb4d introducing the plugin

- [ ] Basic PPC campaign


## Installation 

```bash
npm i -g @juicyllama/llana
npm install
```

## Configutation

### Database

Replace the database connection string `DATABASE_URI` in the `.env` file.

### Authentication 

We currently support two types of authentication:

#### API KEY

By defualt, this expects a table named `users_api_keys` with the field `api_key`, you can override these settings in in the `src/config/auth.config.ts` file.

####Â JWT Token 

We provide a special extra endpoint, the only one not generated based on your database schema. 

* `/auth/login`

This endpoint will take the users login credentials and return back a JWT token, which can be used as authentication for other endpoints (see Restrictions below).

By defualt, this expects a table named `users` with the fields `email` and `password`, you can override these settings in in the `src/config/auth.config.ts` file.

#### Routes

By default any authentications required will apply to all endpoints, you can add exclusions to the config. There is an option to add inclusions for more granular inclusion/exclusion support.

This allows you to open and close specific endpoints to the public.
</div>

### Roles

User roles are an important part of granting the correct permissions to perform relevent actions on the API endpoints.

By default, everything is locked down and no actions can be performed (`NONE`). You can set role `defualts` which will be the fallback if no specific table role permissions have been added.

We provide a defualt configutation you can update/expand `src/config/roles.config.ts`

You can grant roles the ability to `DELETE` which means they can also `READ` and `WRITE`, granting `WRITE` access also allows users to `READ` and finally `READ` access is just that. If you don't want to give a role any permissions then use `NONE`

If the user has insufficent permmissions they will get a `403 Forbidden` response.

*Note:* User roles work in combination with [Authentication](#authentication), if you don't have authentications setup, your API will be fully open and roles do not apply.   

## Building Requests

### Fields

You can specify which fields you would like to return, defualts to `*`

Example `?fields=id,name,content.id`

Note, if you pass deep fields (table.column) then you must pass the table as a relation also.

### Relations

You can fetch deeper content by passing relations, assuming their is a forign key connection it will return the deep result.

Example `?relations=content`

### Pagination 

Pass page into requests to load a specific page result, in the `/list` response you will find the following:

```
"pagination": {
        "total": number, //total results in this page
        "page": {
            "current": string, //the page ref for the current page
            "prev": string, //the page ref for the previous page (if applicable)
            "next": string, //the page ref for the next page (if applicable)
            "first": string,
            "last": string
        }
    },
```

- page (either `next` or `prev` from existing result - helps with pagination)

### Filtering

format is column[operator]=value with operator being from the enum WhereOperator 
      
Example: `?id=1&first_name[equals]=John&age[gte]=21&content.deleted_at[null]`

### Sorting

format is sort={column}.{direction},column.{direction}

`?sort=name.asc,id.desc`

## Endpoints

For every table in your database, you will automatically have access to the following endpoints:

- TODO: Create (POST)
  - TODO: Single `*/`
  - TODO: Bulk `*/bulk`
- Read (GET)
  - Find By Id `*/:id`
  - FindOne `*/`
  - Multiple `*/list`
  - TODO: Charting `*/chart`
- TODO: Update (PUT)
  - TODO: Single `*/:id`
  - TODO: Bulk `*/bulk`
- TODO: Upsert (PATCH)
  - TODO: Single `*/:id`
  - TODO: Bulk `*/bulk`
- TODO: Delete (DELETE)
  - TODO: Single `*/:id`
  - TODO: Bulk `*/bulk`

### Read All

Response Schema: 

```
{
    "limit": number, //records returned for this page
    "offset": number, //the current offset value
    "total": number, //total records for all pages
    "pagination": {}, //see pagination
    "data": [...records]
}
```

Example Response: 

```
{
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 1,
    "pagination": {
        "total": 1,
        "page": {
            "current": "eyJsaW1pdCI6MjAsIm9mZnNldCI6MH0=",
            "prev": null,
            "next": null,
            "first": "eyJsaW1pdCI6MjAsIm9mZnNldCI6MH0=",
            "last": "eyJsaW1pdCI6MjAsIm9mZnNldCI6MH0="
        }
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "email": "email@email.com",
            "password": "**********",
            "role": "ADMIN",
            "first_name": "Jon",
            "last_name": "Doe",
        }
    ]
}
```


## Docker Demos

Out of the box you can use our docker demo data to play with the system. Here is some helpful information:

Test user, email: `test@test.com` password: `test` with API key: `Ex@mp1eS$Cu7eAp!K3y`
